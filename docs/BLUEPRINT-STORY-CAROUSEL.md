## THE STORY

### Slide 1: The Beginning
**Image:** Simple, clean - maybe a phone with Instagram open, or a blank feed

**Text:**
```
Two years ago, I was invisible online.

I had a business. I had clients. But when people looked at my Instagram?

Nothing.

Just... silence.

I was posting, but no one was seeing me. No one was connecting. No one cared.

Sound familiar?

### Slide 2: The Problem
**Image:** Maybe a messy desk, or someone looking frustrated at their phone

**Text:**
```
I was doing everything "right."

Posting consistently. Using hashtags. Following the advice.

But my content felt... generic. Like it could be anyone's.

I didn't have a clear brand. I didn't have a strategy. I was just throwing things at the wall and hoping something stuck.

And honestly? I was exhausted.
```

**CTA:** Keep swiping →

---

### Slide 3: The Realization
**Image:** Lightbulb moment - maybe a notebook with ideas, or someone having an "aha" moment

**Text:**
```
Then I realized something.

The women who were crushing it online? They weren't just posting more.

They had a PLAN.

They knew their brand. They knew their audience. They knew exactly what to post and when.

And I? I was winging it.

That's when I decided to build my own system.
```

**CTA:** See what I built →

### Slide 4: Building the Blueprint
**Image:** Maybe a laptop with the blueprint tool, or a notebook with strategy notes

**Text:**
```
I spent months figuring it out.

What questions do I need to answer? What does my dream client actually want? How do I create content that feels like ME?

I tested it on myself first. Then I shared it with friends. Then with clients.

And it worked.

Not perfectly at first. But it worked.

Now I'm sharing it with you.

Since I started using my blueprint?

My engagement doubled. My followers actually grew. People started DMing me saying "I love your content."

### Slide 7: The Invitation
**Image:** Warm, inviting - maybe a coffee cup or someone working on their brand

**Text:**
```
I built this because I know what it's like to feel stuck.

To post and post and feel like no one sees you.

To wonder "what should I even post today?"

And it's free because I want you to see what's possible.

No pressure. Just try it.

## CAROUSEL POST VARIATIONS

### Variation 1: The "Before I Built This" Angle

**Slide 1:**
```
Before I built the Brand Blueprint, I was posting blind.

Every day, I'd stare at my phone and think:

"What should I post today?"

Sound familiar? 👇
```

**Slide 2:**
```
I'd spend hours trying to come up with content.

Then I'd post it.

Then... crickets.

Two likes. Maybe a comment from my mom.

I was doing everything "right" but nothing was working.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
That's when I realized I was missing something.

A plan. A strategy. A blueprint.

So I built one.

And now? I'm sharing it with you for free.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
The Brand Blueprint takes 10 minutes.

Answer a few questions about your business, your vibe, your goals.

And you get:

• Your 30-day content calendar
• Free Instagram grid preview
• 30 caption templates
• Your visibility score

All free. No credit card needed.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
Since I started using my blueprint, everything changed.

I stopped guessing. I started planning.

My engagement went up. My confidence went up.

And I want that for you too.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
The blueprint is free because I want you to see what's possible.

No pressure. No pitch. Just a free tool that actually works.

Try it. See what happens.

### Variation 2: The "I Know How You Feel" Angle

**Slide 1:**
```
I know how you feel.

You want to build your brand online, but you don't know where to start.

You're posting, but no one's seeing it.

You're trying, but nothing's working.

I've been there. 👇
```

**Slide 2:**
```
Two years ago, I was exactly where you are.

Posting into the void. Feeling invisible. Wondering if it was even worth it.

Then I realized: I needed a plan.

Not just "post more." Not just "use better hashtags."

A real strategy. A blueprint.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
So I built one.

I figured out what questions to ask. What strategy works. What actually moves the needle.

I tested it. I refined it. I made it better.

And now I'm giving it to you for free.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
The Brand Blueprint is free because I remember what it felt like to be stuck.

I remember scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone else's success, and wondering "why not me?"

The blueprint is your answer.

It's your plan. Your strategy. Your way forward.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
Here's what you get:

✓ 30-day content calendar (no more "what should I post?")
✓ Free Instagram grid preview (see your feed before you post)
✓ 30 caption templates (copy, paste, personalize)
✓ Your visibility score (know where you stand)

All in 10 minutes. All free.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
I built this because I care about your success.

Not because I want to sell you something.

Because I know what it's like to feel invisible, and I want you to feel seen.

Try the blueprint. See what happens.

### Variation 3: The "Real Talk" Angle

**Slide 1:**
```
Real talk:

Most of us are posting blind.

We're throwing content at the wall and hoping something sticks.

But the women who are crushing it? They have a plan.

They have a blueprint.

And now you can too. 👇
```

**Slide 2:**
```
I spent months building my brand strategy.

Figuring out what works. What doesn't. What actually moves the needle.

I tested it. I refined it. I made it better.

And honestly? It changed everything.

Now I'm sharing it with you for free.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
The Brand Blueprint is free because I want you to see what's possible.

No credit card. No catch. No "free trial" that turns into a subscription.

Just a free tool that gives you:

• Your 30-day content calendar
• Free Instagram grid preview
• 30 caption templates
• Your visibility score

All in 10 minutes.
```

**Slide 4:**

You can keep posting blind, hoping something works.

Or you can get a plan.

The blueprint is your plan.

It's your strategy. Your roadmap. Your way forward.

And it's free because I want you to try it.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
Since I started using my blueprint:

✓ My engagement doubled
✓ My followers actually grew
✓ People started connecting with my content

But more than that?

I stopped guessing. I started planning.

And you can too.
