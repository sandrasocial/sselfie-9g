# "What's New" Landing Page - Requirements

## Current Situation
The `/whats-new` page is currently text-only and doesn't match the visual quality and conversion optimization of your main landing page.

## What I Need From You

### 1. **Hero Image** (Priority: HIGH)
- **Option A**: Reuse existing hero image (`/images/luxury-portrait.png`)
- **Option B**: Provide a new hero image specifically for "What's New" page
- **Question**: Do you want to use the same hero image as the main landing page, or do you have a different one that better represents the "what's new" message?

### 2. **Feature Showcase Images** (Priority: HIGH)
To show the new features visually, I need:
- **150+ Photos Feature**: Example grid of photos (can be from your existing gallery)
- **Academy Feature**: Screenshot or mockup of the Academy interface
- **Feed Designer Feature**: Screenshot or mockup of the Feed Designer
- **Monthly Drops Feature**: Example of monthly content/strategy

**Question**: 
- Do you have screenshots/mockups of these features?
- Or should I use placeholder images that you can replace later?
- Can I pull example images from your existing image gallery?

### 3. **Testimonials** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Current**: Using "Sarah, Studio Member" testimonial from email
- **Question**: 
  - Do you have more testimonials I should include?
  - Should I pull from your existing testimonial system?
  - Any specific testimonials that highlight the new features?

### 4. **Social Proof / Stats** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Question**: 
  - How many Studio members do you have?
  - Any impressive stats about photos created?
  - User satisfaction metrics?
  - Should I pull these from your database dynamically?

### 5. **Visual Style** (Priority: LOW - I can match existing)
- I'll match your existing landing page style:
  - Same fonts (Times New Roman for headings)
  - Same color scheme (stone palette)
  - Same spacing and layout patterns
  - Same button styles

### 6. **Content** (Priority: LOW - I have from email)
- I have the content from the email template
- **Question**: Any changes to the copy or additional messaging you want?

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Use Existing Assets (FASTEST)
- Reuse hero image from landing page
- Use placeholder images for features (you replace later)
- Pull testimonials from existing system
- **Timeline**: Can build today

### Option 2: Custom Assets (BEST)
- You provide new hero image
- You provide feature screenshots/mockups
- You provide specific testimonials
- **Timeline**: Once assets provided, can build in 1-2 hours

### Option 3: Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)
- Reuse hero image
- I create placeholders for features
- You replace feature images when ready
- **Timeline**: Can build today, you update images later

---

## My Recommendation

**Go with Option 3 (Hybrid)**:
1. I'll build the full page today using:
   - Existing hero image
   - Placeholder images for features (marked clearly)
   - Existing testimonials
   - All the conversion-optimized elements

2. You can then:
   - Replace placeholder images when you have screenshots
   - Add more testimonials
   - Adjust copy if needed

This gets you a professional, conversion-optimized page **today** that you can refine over time.
