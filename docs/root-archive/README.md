# Root Directory Archive

This directory contains markdown documentation files that were moved from the project root to keep it clean.

## Organization

- **Feed Planner documentation**
- **Phase completion reports**
- **Test results and analysis**
- **Implementation plans**

## Access

These files are still accessible and contain important historical documentation about the project's development and refactoring phases.
