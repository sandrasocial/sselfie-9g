# EXECUTION STATUS

- Completed so far:
  - Phase A — Canonicalization & Authority Reset (documentation only).
  - Phase B — System Truth Verification (Read-Only).
  - Phase AO — Access Control Normalization (in progress).
- Current phase: Phase AO — Access Control Normalization (active).
- What was done (Phase B):
  - Mapped live execution paths for Stripe, credits/quota, AI entry points, onboarding, and diagnostics.
  - Identified endpoints with no in-repo references.
  - Updated canonical system reality with verified facts only.
- What was verified (Phase B):
  - Active checkout, portal, upgrade, and webhook paths are wired to UI or server actions.
  - Credits gating present in primary generation routes; credit balance UI uses `/api/user/credits`.
  - Quota endpoints exist but are unreferenced in app code.
  - AI entry points are wired for Classic, Pro, and Video; `/api/studio/generate` is unreferenced.
  - Onboarding completion endpoints are wired to UI flows.
- What was done (Phase C):
  - Gated unused endpoints behind `ENABLE_UNUSED_ENDPOINTS` (default disabled).
  - Updated canonical system reality to reflect gated surface area.
- Gated endpoints (path — reason — replacement/primary path):
  - `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session` — unreferenced — use server actions (`startCreditCheckoutSession`).
  - `/api/stripe/list-products` — unreferenced — none (diagnostic only).
  - `/api/stripe/create-test-coupon` — unreferenced — none (diagnostic only).
  - `/api/stripe/cleanup-products` — unreferenced — none (admin-only cleanup).
  - `/api/stripe/verify-setup` — unreferenced — `/api/admin/diagnostics/stripe-health`.
  - `/api/stripe/test-checkout` — unreferenced — none (diagnostic only).
  - `/api/credits/balance` — unreferenced — `/api/user/credits`.
  - `/api/credits/grant-free-welcome` — unreferenced — none (signup grant not wired).
  - `/api/quota/status` — unreferenced — none (quota not enforced).
  - `/api/quota/decrement` — unreferenced — none (quota not enforced).
  - `/api/studio/generate` — unreferenced — `/api/maya/generate-image` or `/api/maya/pro/generate-image`.
- Risks remaining:
  - Lint passes with warnings only (12963 warnings).
  - Playwright E2E suites are skipped in Vitest (require Playwright runner).
  - Quota endpoints remain present but deprecated.
- What was done (Phase AF):
  - Aligned training cost UI to 20 credits and set paid blueprint credits to 60.
  - Fixed zero-credits CTA label, wired credit balance CTA, improved paid blueprint polling copy.
- What was done (Phase AH):
  - Aligned admin observability empty states for health and cron pages.
  - Confirmed admin nav uses authoritative analytics route (`/admin/conversions`).
- What was done (Phase AJ):
  - Exposed growth and conversion key metrics as text summaries (no new data sources).
  - Added blueprint completion + paid conversion labels and split top-up vs membership conversions.
  - Deduped Today’s Focus cards to prevent duplicate operator signals.
- What was done (Phase AO):
  - Entitlements override feature flags for paid blueprint and members (training/strategist access).
  - Preview credits refresh now updates without page reload; upsell triggers from live balance.
  - Paid blueprint $0 checkout treated as paid in webhook flow.
  - Legacy membership/one-time access normalized (full app except Academy).
  - Credit top-up success redirects back to feed planner.
  - Retry on Replicate 502 and show friendly error when image generation is down.
- What was done (Phase D):
  - Marked credits-only enforcement as authoritative in canonical docs.
  - Marked quota endpoints as deprecated and non-authoritative.

 - What was done (Phase AB):
  - Added domain-level feature-flag gating (default OFF) for high-cost auth-only AI routes:
    - `ENABLE_MAYA_AI`:
      - `app/api/maya/generate-concepts/route.ts`
      - `app/api/maya/generate-feed-prompt/route.ts`
      - `app/api/maya/generate-all-feed-prompts/route.ts`

      - `app/api/feed/add-more/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/refresh-concepts/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/generate-strategy/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/generate-highlights/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/enhance-caption/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/add-highlight-overlay/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/add-row/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed/[feedId]/generate-profile/route.ts`
      - `app/api/feed-planner/enhance-goal/route.ts`
    - `ENABLE_STRATEGIST_AI`:
      - `app/api/instagram-strategist/generate-captions/route.ts`
      - `app/api/content-research-strategist/research/route.ts`
      - `app/api/personal-brand-strategist/strategy/route.ts`
    - `ENABLE_TRAINING_AI`:
      - `app/api/training/start-training/route.ts`
 - What was done (Phase AC):
  - Env check:
    - Stripe envs present (live keys detected).
    - AI provider keys present (Anthropic/OpenAI/Replicate).
    - New AI domain flags not set in `.env.local` (default OFF): `ENABLE_MAYA_AI`, `ENABLE_FEED_AI`, `ENABLE_STRATEGIST_AI`, `ENABLE_TRAINING_AI`.
  - Build: `npm run build` now succeeds after `/blueprint/paid` Suspense fix.
  - Lint: `npm run lint` passes with 12963 warnings (warnings-only mode).
  - Tests: `npm test` passes (2 files passed, 5 skipped).
  - AI domain readiness (default OFF unless explicitly enabled):
    - Maya: OFF
    - Feed: OFF
    - Strategist: OFF
    - Training: OFF
  - GO/NO-GO: GO (build passes). Risks: warnings volume high; Playwright E2E still skipped.
 - What was done (Phase AD):
  - Deploy-time requirements confirmed from `.env.local`:
    - Stripe live mode keys present.
    - Supabase/database URLs present.
    - AI provider keys present.
  - Flags confirmed in repo:
    - Baseline functionality restored (no `ENABLE_MAYA_AI` / `ENABLE_FEED_AI` gating).
    - Optional/guarded flows remain flag-controlled: `ENABLE_TRAINING_AI`, `ENABLE_STRATEGIST_AI`, `ENABLE_BLUEPRINT_GUEST`, `ENABLE_BLUEPRINT_PAID`, `ENABLE_BLUEPRINT_CONCEPT_IMAGE`, `ENABLE_UNUSED_ENDPOINTS`.
  - Minimal smoke test checklist prepared (manual).
 - Baseline vs optional capability:
  - Baseline always-on: Maya + Feed AI endpoints (auth/credit enforcement only).
  - Optional/guarded: Training, Strategist, Blueprint guest, unused endpoints.

 - What was done (Phase AO-2B):
  - Ran read-only DB queries and Stripe API checks using env credentials.
  - Free credits: 184 free users total; 63 with exact 2-credit grant; 121 missing grant; 0 duplicate grants.
  - Paid blueprint: 8 entitlements; 5 linked to user_id; 2 missing timestamps; 3 missing user_id.
  - Membership credits: 30 active members; 1 missing monthly grant; 9 stale grants (>40 days).
  - Credit top-ups: 0 subscriptions with product_type = credit_topup.
  - Onboarding persistence (active subs): 36 total; 6 completed; 2 with profiles; 29 missing both.
  - Schema checks: required columns exist; schema_migrations contains 4 of 5 expected entries (missing 015 entry but column exists).
  - Stripe: webhook endpoint enabled for `https://sselfie.ai/api/webhooks/stripe`.
  - Stripe events last 7d: checkout.session.completed=34, invoice.payment_succeeded=10, subscription.created=1, updated=20, deleted=3.
  - Webhook errors last 7d: 0. stripe_payments last 7d: 0 rows.
 - Verified OK (Phase AO-2B):
  - No duplicate free welcome bonuses in credit ledger.
  - No credit_topup subscriptions created.
  - No stuck payments in `processing/pending` > 1 day.
  - Stripe webhook endpoint enabled with expected URL.
 - Runtime mismatches / Broken (Phase AO-2B):
  - ❌ 121 free users missing the 2-credit welcome bonus (core entitlement invariant broken).
  - ❌ 1 active member missing monthly credits; 9 members stale >40 days (core entitlement drift).
  - ❌ Stripe events present in last 7d, but `stripe_payments` has 0 rows last 7d (webhook ingestion gap risk).
 - Known unknowns (Phase AO-2B):
  - Paid blueprint entitlements missing user_id for 3/8 (may be legacy email-only).
  - Paid blueprint payments not present in `stripe_payments` (0 in last 30d for product_type='paid_blueprint').
  - Onboarding persistence gaps may be expected for older users; needs product confirmation.
  - schema_migrations missing `015_add_product_type_to_credit_transactions` record despite column existing.
 - STOP recommendations (Phase AO-2B):
  - STOP: Free welcome credits and monthly member credits are out of compliance with invariants.
  - STOP: Webhook ingestion gap (Stripe events without stripe_payments rows) requires investigation before certifying runtime integrity.

 - What was done (Phase AO-3A):
  - Diagnosed welcome credits grant path: credits are granted on `/studio` load for free users (not at signup).
  - Ran idempotent backfill scripts (READ/WRITE, no critical file edits):
    - `scripts/backfill/backfill-free-welcome-credits.ts`
    - `scripts/backfill/backfill-membership-credits.ts`
  - Verified post-backfill counts with SELECT queries.
 - Before/After (Phase AO-3A):
  - Free users (welcome credits):
    - Before: free_users=185, exact_grant=64, missing=121, bad=0.
    - After: free_users=185, exact_grant=185, missing=0, bad=0.
  - Membership credits (monthly grants):
    - Before: active_members=30, with_grant=29, missing=1, stale>40d=9.
    - After: active_members=30, with_grant=30, missing=0, stale>40d=0.
 - Verified OK (Phase AO-3A):
  - No duplicate welcome bonuses created (0 duplicate users).
  - All free users now have exactly one 2-credit welcome bonus.
  - All active members have a recent monthly grant (<=40 days).
 - Remaining risks (Phase AO-3A):
  - Root cause for stale monthly grants likely linked to webhook/stripe_payments ingestion gap (see AO-2B) — not fixed here.
 - Rollback notes (Phase AO-3A):
  - If rollback is required, use compensating negative credit transactions and adjust balances; do NOT delete ledger rows.

 - What was done (Phase AO-3B):
  - Added idempotent recent Stripe payments backfill script: `scripts/backfill/backfill-stripe-payments-recent.ts`.
  - Added reconciliation cron endpoint: `/api/cron/reconcile-credits` (welcome credits + monthly grants + optional Stripe reconcile).
  - Scheduled daily cron in `vercel.json`: `0 5 * * *`.
  - Ran recent Stripe backfill for last 30 days:
    - Before: stripe_payments last_7d=0, last_30d=16, last_payment_date=2026-01-03.
    - After: stripe_payments last_7d=10, last_30d=26, last_payment_date=2026-01-16.
  - Attempted local cron invocation for `/api/cron/reconcile-credits`; received HTTP 400/socket close (needs runtime verification in prod).
 - Verified OK (Phase AO-3B):
  - stripe_payments now reflects recent live payments after backfill.
 - Known unknowns (Phase AO-3B):
  - Reconcile cron runtime execution not verified (local call failed).
  - Stripe backfill covers last 30 days only; historical integrity still depends on existing backfill or webhook correctness.
 - Rollback notes (Phase AO-3B):
  - Remove `/api/cron/reconcile-credits` from `vercel.json` to stop scheduled runs.
  - Revert new backfill script and cron route if needed (no data rollback performed).

 - What was done (Phase AO-3C):
  - Confirmed cron auth contract: expects `authorization` header with `Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`.
  - Verified production env var presence via Vercel CLI:
    - CRON_SECRET: present
    - RECONCILE_STRIPE_PAYMENTS: missing
    - STRIPE_RECONCILE_DAYS: missing
  - Triggered prod reconcile endpoint twice with auth header: both returned HTTP 400.
  - Admin surfaces checked in prod: `/admin/diagnostics/cron` loads; `/admin/cron-health` shows no data on page load; `/admin/health` loads.
  - Verified DB idempotency counts before/after manual calls (duplicates remain 0).
 - HTTP results (Phase AO-3C):
  - 2026-01-16T14:03:28Z — HTTP 400 — body: `400 Bad Request`.
  - 2026-01-16T14:03:38Z — HTTP 400 — body: `400 Bad Request`.
 - DB before/after (Phase AO-3C):
  - Welcome bonus duplicates: 0 → 0.
  - Monthly grant duplicates (40d window): 0 → 0.
  - stripe_payments duplicates: 0 → 0.
 - Runtime mismatches / Blockers (Phase AO-3C):
  - ❌ Production `/api/cron/reconcile-credits` returns HTTP 400 with auth header (endpoint not runnable).
  - ⚠️ Optional reconcile env vars missing (Stripe reconcile disabled by default).
 - STOP recommendations (Phase AO-3C):
  - STOP: Cannot certify prod cron execution until endpoint returns 200 and auth header is accepted.
  - Validate CRON_SECRET value in production matches the caller secret.
