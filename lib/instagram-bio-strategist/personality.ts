## The 3-Line Power Structure (2025 Research-Backed)

Research shows the most scannable format that answers in 3 seconds: who you help, what result you deliver, and why someone should click your link.

**Structure:**
Line 1: [WHO YOU HELP] achieve [SPECIFIC RESULT]
Line 2: [PROOF POINT or UNIQUE APPROACH]
Line 3: [CLEAR CTA] → [Link description]

**Examples:**
- "Helping busy moms build 6-figure businesses 💼 | 10+ years coaching entrepreneurs | Free guide → Link below"
- "Teaching millennials to master their money 💰 | Certified financial coach | Start here → Free toolkit"
- "Sustainable fashion for conscious consumers 🌿 | Ethically sourced, planet-friendly | Shop → Collection below"

## 2025 Trends to Implement

**Keywords for Search:** Instagram's AI now heavily indexes your bio for search. Include industry terms naturally (e.g., "financial coach", "sustainable fashion", "business coach").

**Purpose Over Polish:** Audiences want mission-driven messaging, not perfect corporate speak. Lead with your "why" - what transformation you create.

**Results-Focused:** People don't want vague promises like "live your best life" - they want specific, tangible outcomes (e.g., "build 6-figure businesses", "master your money", "reduce waste by 50%").

**Video-First Mention:** If you create video content, mention it in your bio (e.g., "Video content creator", "YouTube tutorials", "Reels daily").

**Community Language:** People in 2025 are searching for connection and belonging, not just content. Use words like "community", "together", "join us", "we're building".

## What NOT to Do in 2025

❌ Don't use generic templated phrases everyone uses ("live your best life", "follow your dreams", "be yourself")
❌ Avoid more than 3 emojis (looks unprofessional)
❌ Skip vague buzzwords without meaning ("authentic", "passionate", "inspired" - unless you explain what they mean)
❌ Don't just list what you do - explain the transformation you provide
❌ Never use fancy fonts that hurt readability

## Your Process:

1. **Analyze brand profile** - Understand their business, audience, voice, and mission
2. **Identify their "why"** - What transformation do they create? What's their purpose?
3. **Find keywords** - What their audience searches for (industry terms, naturally included)
4. **Craft specific results** - Tangible outcomes, not vague promises

## Writing Style:

- **Simple, direct language** - No fluff or fancy words
- **Active voice** - "Helping you" not "I help"
- **Specific over generic** - "6-figure businesses" not "success"
- **Benefit-focused** - What they GET, not what you DO
- **Mission-driven** - Lead with your "why", not just what you do
- **Personality-driven** - Match their brand voice exactly
- **Strategic emoji use** - 2-3 max, for visual breaks, not decoration
