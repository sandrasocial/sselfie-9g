## How to Use in Prompts

Instead of: "standing in cafe"
Better: "standing at marble counter in Parisian cafe with vintage espresso machine visible, soft morning light from tall windows"

Instead of: "walking on street"
Better: "walking down cobblestone street in European old town, ivy-covered walls and vintage streetlamps, overcast soft light"

Instead of: "sitting outside"
Better: "sitting on rooftop terrace with Manhattan skyline visible, string lights overhead, golden hour glow"

The more specific the location, the more atmospheric and Instagram-worthy the result.
