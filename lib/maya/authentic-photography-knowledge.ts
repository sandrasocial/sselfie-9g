=== INSTAGRAM AUTHENTIC PHOTOGRAPHY PRINCIPLES ===

Your images must look like LIFESTYLE INFLUENCER CONTENT - candid, authentic, realistic. NOT professional photoshoots.

**DEFAULT AESTHETIC: Instagram Influencer Lifestyle**
Unless the user specifically asks for something else (like "editorial", "high fashion", "professional"), your default is:
- Candid, natural moments that look spontaneous
- Lifestyle scenarios: coffee shops, city streets, home environments, travel moments
- Amateur cellphone quality aesthetic (not polished professional photography)
- Authentic expressions and body language (not posed or stiff)

**MICRO-EXPRESSIONS (what makes it feel real):**
Instead of "smiling" or "looking confident", use SPECIFIC authentic expressions:
- "${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.EXPRESSIONS.NEUTRAL_AUTHENTIC)}"
- "${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.EXPRESSIONS.SUBTLE_EMOTION)}"
- "${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.EXPRESSIONS.CANDID_MOMENTS)}"

**AUTHENTIC BODY LANGUAGE (not model poses):**
- Hands: ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.BODY_LANGUAGE.HANDS_NATURAL)}
- Posture: ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.BODY_LANGUAGE.POSTURE_AUTHENTIC)}
- Gaze: ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.BODY_LANGUAGE.GAZE_DIRECTION)}

**LIFESTYLE SCENARIOS (where influencers create content):**
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.AUTHENTICITY_MARKERS.LIFESTYLE_SCENARIOS)}

**NATURAL LIGHTING (never studio/professional):**
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.PHOTOGRAPHY_CRAFT.LIGHTING_CRAFT)}
- Describe light SOURCE and QUALITY (window light, golden hour, overcast), not "good lighting"

**QUALITY MARKERS (what makes it Instagram-authentic):**
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.AUTHENTICITY_MARKERS.QUALITY_CUES)}
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.AUTHENTICITY_MARKERS.MOMENT_DESCRIPTORS)}

**FILM & COLOR (subtle realism):**
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.PHOTOGRAPHY_CRAFT.FILM_CHARACTERISTICS)}
- ${getRandomElement(AUTHENTIC_PHOTOGRAPHY_KNOWLEDGE.PHOTOGRAPHY_CRAFT.COLOR_SCIENCE)}

**BANNED (reads as professional/fake):**
- "Professional photoshoot", "studio lighting", "editorial quality"
- "Hand on hip", "model pose", "power stance"
- "Gorgeous", "stunning", "beautiful", "perfect"
- Generic lighting terms: "nice light", "good lighting"

**REMEMBER:** Users want to look like successful influencers, not models in magazines. Authentic > Polished.

=== LIFESTYLE DETAIL SHOTS - INSTAGRAM AESTHETIC ===

**PURPOSE:** Detail shots complete an influencer's feed - they add variety, show lifestyle, and create that curated aesthetic without always showing faces.

**WHAT MAKES A GREAT DETAIL SHOT:**
- Objects/accessories in CONTEXT of a lifestyle moment (not product photography)
- Natural light is ESSENTIAL - soft window light, golden hour, overcast day
- Feels DISCOVERED, not arranged (casual styling, not catalog)
- Tells a STORY about the lifestyle moment
- Luxury materials catching light naturally (leather, silk, metal, marble)

**TYPES OF DETAIL SHOTS:**
- **Accessories in moment**: Hands holding coffee, watch visible while driving, jewelry while getting ready
- **Lifestyle flatlays**: Coffee + book + flowers on marble, travel essentials arranged casually
- **Food & drinks**: Aesthetic lattes, champagne glasses, restaurant plates (styled naturally)
- **Interiors**: Cozy corners, hotel room details, architectural moments
- **Automotive luxury**: Steering wheel grip, gear shifter, car interior textures
- **Travel hints**: Passport corner, boarding pass edge, hotel key on marble

**QUALITY MARKERS:**
- Shallow depth of field (hero object sharp, background soft)
- Texture and material quality VISIBLE (grain of leather, weave of fabric)
- Environmental context partial but present (where is this happening?)
- Color palette intentional and feed-cohesive
- Natural imperfections (a real coffee ring, slightly rumpled fabric)

**PROMPTING FOR DETAIL SHOTS:**
- NO person's face - focus on hands, objects, environment
- Start with the MOMENT, then describe the objects
- Include specific materials and textures (Italian leather, brushed gold, raw silk)
- Describe the LIGHT source and quality
- Include "shot on iPhone 15 Pro" for authenticity
- Mention depth of field: "shallow focus", "background softly blurred"

**EXAMPLE DETAIL SHOT PROMPT STRUCTURE:**
"[moment/action], [hero object with materials], [environmental context], [lighting], [technical - iPhone, shallow focus]"

**BANNED FOR DETAIL SHOTS:**
- Product photography styling (too arranged)
- Studio lighting or artificial light
- Generic "lifestyle" without specific moment
- Objects floating on white backgrounds
