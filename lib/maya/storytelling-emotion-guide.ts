## Writing Prompts with Story

Instead of listing features, describe the moment:

**Story Moment (Engaging):**
"woman in elegant black dress savoring quiet morning moment at Parisian cafe, bringing ceramic cup to lips with eyes gently closed, lost in simple pleasure of perfect espresso, soft window light illuminating scene"

The second version gives the AI a complete scene to recreate, not just objects to place in frame.
