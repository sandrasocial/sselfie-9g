## Template 1: Photo Tips
**Caption:**
```
3 mistakes killing your personal brand photos:

1. Hiding your face
You're not a corporation. People buy from PEOPLE.

2. Inconsistent aesthetic
Your grid should tell a story, not look random.

3. Using the same 5 photos for months
Fresh content = algorithm loves you.

SSELFIE solves all 3.

## Template 2: Content Strategy
**Caption:**
```
How I plan a month of content in 1 hour:

1. Choose your vibe (luxury, minimal, edgy, etc.)
2. Generate 100+ photos in that aesthetic
3. Use Feed Planner to map it out
4. Write captions in batch
5. Schedule and forget

This used to take me DAYS.
Now? 1 hour.

## Template 3: Before/After Education
**Caption:**
```
Why your photos don't convert (and how to fix it):

BEFORE:
❌ Generic stock photos
❌ Blurry selfies  
❌ Hiding behind your logo

AFTER:
✅ Professional quality
✅ Actually looks like you
✅ Consistent aesthetic

The difference? Being the face of your brand.

## Template 4: Authenticity Over Perfection
**Caption:**
```
Authenticity over perfection. Progress over perfection. Community over competition.

I believe technology should empower, not intimidate.

I believe entrepreneurs deserve tools that work as hard as they do.

And I believe showing up is better than staying silent.

What do you believe? 💕

## Template 5: The Content Struggle
**Caption:**
```
I was tired of spending hours trying to get the "perfect selfie" for Instagram, only to post nothing at all.

Sound familiar?

I realized AI could change this - not by replacing our creativity, but by amplifying it.

That's why I built SSELFIE.

If you're struggling with content, you're not alone. And there's a better way.
