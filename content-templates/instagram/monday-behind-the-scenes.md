## Template 1: Building in Public
**Caption:**
```
Building SSELFIE at 6 AM because I can't sleep when I have ideas 😅

This week I'm working on [specific feature]. The goal is to make it even easier for you to [outcome].

What feature do you want to see next?

## Template 2: Customer Win
**Caption:**
```
This message made my entire week 🥹

[Customer name] just hit [milestone] using SSELFIE photos.

This is why I built this. Not for the tech - for moments like these.

If you're still hiding behind your logo, let's change that.

## Template 3: Founder Story
**Caption:**
```
Real talk: I built SSELFIE because I was too broke to hire a photographer.

I had good ideas, a solid business plan, but every time I needed professional photos? $500-1500.

So I built an AI that could do it for $49.

Now 2,700+ people use it. Wild.

What's stopping you from showing your face online?

## Template 4: Behind the Scenes - Daily Life
**Caption:**
```
My day usually starts with coffee and checking user feedback ☕

I love hearing what's working and what's not. I'm constantly thinking about how to make SSELFIE better - whether I'm in a meeting, working out, or just scrolling Instagram.

Ideas hit me at the weirdest times, and my Notes app is full of random thoughts at 2am.

What's in your Notes app right now? 😅

## Template 5: The Messy Middle
**Caption:**
```
Building a startup is lonely sometimes.

There are moments of doubt - am I building the right thing? Is this feature too complicated? Why isn't growth happening faster?

But then a user sends me a message saying SSELFIE changed their content game, and I remember why I'm doing this.

Every struggle teaches me something.

If you're in the messy middle too, you're not alone 💕
